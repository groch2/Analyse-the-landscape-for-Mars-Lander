You are working on a autopilot for the Mars Lander, as in the "Mars Lander - Episode 2" CodingGame puzzle. The landscape is made of a list of points, which are linked in contiguous pairs to represent the surface of Mars, and there is a single part of horizontal ground which is the target landing site. You doesn't know where the shuttle will appear, but you can assume that it will be from an end of the landscape limits that is higher that the highest point of the landscape, so in order to prepare for a safe landing, you must reduce the list of the points of the landscape to get a convex landscape on both sides of the target landing site. This convex landscape will represente the minimum altitude that the shuttle must maintain, because if it goes below, it will have to go out, thus making the trajectory more complicated, and wasting fuel.
